            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p> Established in 1975 by Michael Pozzouli, who is originally from Naples, Italy, the birth place of pizza, Michael's Pizza is a "Greenwich Village institution" offering the classic New York slice for over 37 years. First, we served our customers fromour corner location at Bleecker and Carmine Street and now three doors down at 7 Carmine Street. At 75 years of age, Michael Pozzuoli still owns and operates the resturant.
            
            Michael's Pizza is a perennial top 10 listing in resturant guides and publications such as Time Out New York and New York Magazine. NEW YORK MAGAZINE named Michael's Pizza "Best of New York" and in subsequent reviews reffered to us as "the quintessential New York slice." In 2009 GQ Magazine listde Michael's Pizza as one of the "Best 25 Pizzas on Earth"
            
            Throughout the years Michael's Pizza in Greenwich Village has becoome just as popular with visitors and tourists as it is ith native New Yorkers who know where to come for an authenthic New York street slice.
            
            After 38 years, Michael's is still an independently owned buisness at only one locaton , personally supervised by founder Michael's himself. We still are what we've always been: a classic NY slice joint. No glossy corporate backing, no fancy pants pies, no pretentious nonsense and no gimmicky budget pizza either. We are tried and true - the real deal.</p>
